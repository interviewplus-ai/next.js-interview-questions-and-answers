## 1. How do you create a new Next.js project?

```bash
npx create-next-app my-app
```

## 2. How do you create a new page in Next.js?

In the pages directory, create a new file with the desired name and export a React component. For example:

```javascript
// pages/about.js
import React from 'react';

const AboutPage = () => {
  return <h1>About Page</h1>;
};

export default AboutPage;
```

## 3. How can you fetch data in Next.js?

Next.js provides the getStaticProps or getServerSideProps functions for fetching data. Here's an example using getStaticProps:

```javascript
export async function getStaticProps() {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
  const data = await res.json();

  return {
    props: {
      data,
    },
  };
}

const HomePage = ({ data }) => {
  // Use the fetched data
  return <h1>{data.title}</h1>;
};

export default HomePage;
```

## 4. How do you create dynamic routes in Next.js?

Create a file with square brackets ([]) in the pages directory. The file name will be used as a template for the dynamic routes. For example:

```javascript
// pages/posts/[id].js
import React from 'react';
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

const PostPage = () => {
  const router = useRouter();
  const { id } = router.query;

  return <h1>Post {id}</h1>;
};

export default PostPage;
```

## 5. How can you style components in Next.js?


Next.js supports various styling solutions like CSS modules, CSS-in-JS libraries (e.g., styled-components), and global CSS files. Here's an example using CSS modules:

```javascript
import styles from './Button.module.css';

const Button = () => {
  return <button className={styles.button}>Click me</button>;
};

export default Button;
```

## 6. How do you handle form submissions in Next.js?

Next.js provides a built-in API route system for handling form submissions. Create an API route and use the req and res parameters to process the form data. For example:

```javascript
// pages/api/submit.js
export default function handler(req, res) {
  const { email } = req.body;

  // Process the form data
  // ...

  res.status(200).json({ message: 'Form submitted successfully!' });
}
```

## 7. How can you optimize the performance of Next.js applications?

Next.js provides several optimization techniques such as static site generation (SSG), server-side rendering (SSR), and automatic code splitting. Additionally, you can use features like caching, lazy loading, and optimizing images.

## 8. How do you handle errors in Next.js?

Next.js provides an ErrorBoundary component for handling errors in a Next.js application. You can wrap the component tree with this component to catch and handle errors. 

For example:

```javascript
import { ErrorBoundary } from 'next/error';

const MyApp = ({ Component, pageProps }) => {
  return (
    <ErrorBoundary>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </ErrorBoundary>
  );
};

export default MyApp;
```

## 9. How can you implement authentication in Next.js?

Next.js can work with any authentication system, but popular libraries like NextAuth.js and Firebase Authentication provide easy integration. Refer to their documentation for specific implementation details.

## 10. How do you deploy a Next.js application?

Next.js applications can be deployed to various platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or Heroku. Most platforms provide seamless integration and easy deployment using CLI or Git-based workflows. Refer to the platform's documentation for deployment instructions.

## 11. How do you handle API requests in Next.js?

Next.js provides an api directory to create API routes. You can define your serverless functions inside these files. 

For example:

```javascript
// pages/api/users.js
export default function handler(req, res) {
  const users = [
    { id: 1, name: 'John Doe' },
    { id: 2, name: 'Jane Smith' },
  ];

  res.status(200).json(users);
}
```

## 12. How can you handle metadata and SEO in Next.js?

Next.js supports setting metadata and handling SEO using the next/head component. You can dynamically set the page title, description, and other metadata based on the page content. 

For example:

```javascript
import Head from 'next/head';

const HomePage = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <Head>
        <title>My Website</title>
        <meta name="description" content="Welcome to my website" />
      </Head>
      <h1>Welcome to my website</h1>
    </>
  );
};

export default HomePage;
```
